# code practice/design choice

1. Use early returns instead of long if statements to ensure future extensiability of code. (for example, if more filters are needed in the future before processing a request)
2. Try to keep time complexity low when retrieving information, it's fine to shift complexity to addition of information. Sacrificing a bit of space complexity is fine.
